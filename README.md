# New York Times Article

> This project was a replication of The New york Times article webpage.

![screenshot](/images/page-screenshot.png)

We used only HTML and CSS for this project, we used grid, flexbox and float to position most of the elements. We tried to copy most of the effects
of the original webpage, like hovering and color changes. Our website is not functional, is just a visual replica.
